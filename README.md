## Robot Data Structure

Each robot contains the following information:

```typescript
interface Robot {
  robotId: string;
  name: string;
  model: string;
  status: "On Delivery" | "Idle" | "Charging" | "Error" | "Returning";
  batteryLevel: number;
  location: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  currentOrder: {
    orderId: string;
    customerName: string;
    deliveryAddress: string;
    estimatedDelivery: string;
  };
}
```

## Features in Detail

### Robot Cards

- Display robot name, ID, and current status
- Show battery level with color-coded progress indicator
- Display current delivery information
- Status badges with color coding (Green: Idle, Blue: On Delivery, Orange: Returning, etc.)

### Fleet Management
